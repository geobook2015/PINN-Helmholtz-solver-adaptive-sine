# PINN-Helmholtz-solver-adaptive-sine
**This repository reproduces the results of the submitted paper "A versatile framework to solve the Helmholtz equation using physics-informed neural networks." to Geophysical Journal International.**

# Overview

We applied the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the Helmholtz equation for isotropic and anisotropic media. The proposed method has resilience and versatility in predicting frequency-domain wavefields for different media and model shapes.
